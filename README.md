# Morris Animal Refuge Store Front-end
This project was created by students at Drexel Westphal, in partnership with morris animal refuge and aycmedia.

The Morris Animal Refuge was looking for an online store to help raise funds for animal care.
Our solution was two sites:
1) A custom cafepress store page. Allowing the shelter to begin selling immediately, as well as figure out what products sell best before they need to stock inventory.

2) This site. A jekyll template site to be later referenced by aycmedia in developing the final store.
